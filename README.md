# Recurrent neural network: Human text VS generated by LLM

## :beginner: Getting started!

`✅ Step 1.` Download the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/starblasters8/human-vs-llm-text-corpus/data).

`✅ Step 2.` Unzip the downloaded archive into the **"data"** folder in your project.

`✅ Step 3.` If you need to reduce its size, use [resize.ipynb](https://github.com/a13xe/RNN-Human-vs-LLM/blob/main/resize.ipynb) to save some time on training.

`✅ Step 4.` Don't forget to change the path to your dataset and run the [RNN.ipynb](https://github.com/a13xe/RNN-Human-vs-LLM/blob/main/RNN.ipynb).
